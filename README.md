## C Calculator Project

- My main goal is making a full functioning calculator that written in C with Clang
- It has different syntax error handlers
- It supports decimal and hexadecimal numbers for now
- It has this operators:
  - Summation (+)
  - Subtraction (-) 
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Prime (^)
    - Usage is simple, a^b means $a^b$
  - Radicals (v)
    - Usage is simple, avb means $\sqrt[a]{b}$
